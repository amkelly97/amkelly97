# About Me

Hi! My name is Alec Kelly, and I am a second year Information Technology & Cybersecurity major (my second undergrad degree!) at Wright State University! I hope to get in the habit of updating this GitHub and exploring more as I continue my education and later start my professional journey!

## Upcoming Projects
*Technical Briefing and Project Proposal*: A technical writing essay and presentation to demonstrate knowledge on technical writing, presenting a proposal on an assigned engineering work in which the group is assigned to effectively communicate the features and specifications of the work.

*Password Cracker Coding Project*: A coding project (for strictly educational purposes) in which code is written to figure out randomly generated passwords.
